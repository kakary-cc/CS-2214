(a) The capacity of program counter needs to be changed from 4 to 10 bits.
E15 turbo has a capacity for up to 1024 instruction, so the last instruction numbered 1023 would need 10 bits to represent in binary.
(b) The length per instruction will be changed from 12 to 18 bits.
Change in the program counter's capacity will also increase length of immediate values from 4 to 10 bits so instructions like jmp, jz, and jnz can function properly.
(c) Capacity of the general-purpose registers needs to be changed from 4 to 10 bits, as increase in immediate value's length allows 10 bits to be passed into general-purpose registers through the movi instruction.
(d) Capacity of each ROM cell needs to be changed from 12 to 18 bits to store the longer instructions.
(e) ALUs need to support 10 bit input and output to handle 10 bit immediate values and general-purpose registers, as well as a 10 bit program counter register.
