Design Idea
	I used an STL `list` to maintain the LRU structure within a single row.
	Though I initially proposed using a `queue`, it has a bit of complication in regards to updating the ordering when the address accessed caused a HIT.
	The program does not actually load data into or write from the simulated cache, as doing so is not necessary for the purpose of creating the log and it won't bring any improvement in performance as an actual cache would do.
